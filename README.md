# Elective Selector Application

The Elective Selector Application is a web and Android app designed to streamline the process of choosing elective subjects for students. It provides a user-friendly interface for both students and professors, allowing them to efficiently manage elective selection and access valuable learning resources.

## Features

- **Elective Selection**: Students can view the available elective subjects posted by their professors and choose their preferred options. Electives are assigned on a first come, first serve basis, with students automatically being moved to their second choice if their first choice reaches its capacity.

- **Learning Resources**: Students have access to a variety of learning resources associated with each elective subject. These resources aim to enhance their understanding of the electives and assist in making informed decisions.

- **Professor Dashboard**: Professors have a dedicated dashboard where they can view a table of students enrolled in their elective subjects for the semester. This allows professors to easily track which students have chosen which electives.

- **Export to Excel Sheets**: Professors can export the elective selection data in a table format to Excel sheets. This feature enables easy manual updates and further analysis if required.

- **Announcement Screen**: Both students and professors have access to an announcement screen where important messages and updates are posted. This keeps everyone informed and ensures seamless communication within the app.
